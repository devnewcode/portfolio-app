      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hi, I’m Devrath Teotia, a passionate and detail-oriented Full Stack Developer based in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh. With a strong foundation in computer applications and a keen interest in modern web technologies, I specialize in developing scalable, responsive, and user-friendly web applications.</p>
      <p>I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Applications and am currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Applications from IMS Engineering College. Over the past few years, I’ve gained hands-on experience in building real-world projects using React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Next.js, while continuously improving my understanding of both frontend and backend systems.</p>
      <p>My journey in development began with a strong curiosity about how digital systems work, and since then, I’ve worked on impactful projects including a Registration Management System for Viplava 2024, a Restaurant Management App, and an E-commerce Shopping Cart Platform. These projects allowed me to enhance user experience, automate processes, and optimize performance, all while collaborating with teams and handling real-time challenges.</p>
      <p>Beyond the code, I value clear communication, adaptability, and analytical thinking. I enjoy solving complex problems and transforming ideas into robust solutions that provide value to users.</p>
      <p>Whether I’m designing intuitive UIs or building efficient backend systems, my goal is always the same: to create applications that are both functional and enjoyable to use.</p>
