    "description": "As a voluntary Full Stack Developer for Viplava 2024, a youth anti-addiction festival organized by ISKCON Youth Forum, I developed a complete registration management system that efficiently handled over 700 registrations. I built a responsive landing page, implemented secure form validation, integrated both online and offline payment options, and created a referral system to boost outreach. Additionally, I automated email confirmations using the Gmail API to streamline communication and reduce manual follow-up. This project allowed me to contribute technically to a meaningful cause, supporting event coordination and improving the overall registration experience.",
